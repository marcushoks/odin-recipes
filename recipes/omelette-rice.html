    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Similar in flavor and style to hash browns and eggs, this delicious
      Japanese dish works wonderfully as breakfast, lunch, or dinner, especially
      for those not completely ready for the traditional raw fish or white rice.

      <li>Prep: 5 mins</li>
      <li>Cook: 15 mins</li>
      <li>Total: 20 mins</li>
      <li>Servings: 1</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup cooked white or brown rice</li>
      <li>2 thin slices cooked ham, cubed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
      <li>1 slice processed cheese food (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a skillet over medium heat, and coat with cooking spray. Add the
        cooked rice, 2 tablespoons ketchup, ham, and cheese, if using. Cook and
        stir until the ingredients are well combined and heated through, about 8
        minutes. Scoop the mixture onto a serving bowl and shape into an oval.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, beat eggs and salt and pepper. Heat a small skillet coated
        with cooking spray over medium heat. Add egg mixture; cook over medium
        heat. As eggs set, lift edges, letting uncooked portion flow underneath.
        Use a spatula to gently fold the eggs into a cocoon shape. When eggs are
        completely set, remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the omelette on top of the rice and run a knife length-wise
        through the top layer of the omelette. It should open like a butterfly
        and drape over the rice. Top with the final tablespoon of ketchup and a
        sprinkle of parsley.
